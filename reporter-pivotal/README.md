# Reporter Pivotal-Tracker

This is the `BugReporter` for [Pivotal-Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) so your testers/yourself can create issues right on it with all the info you want.

If you want to create your own `BugReporter` for your not currently supported service you can check: [Custom Bug Repostory Docs](https://github.com/BaristaVentures/debug-artist/blob/develop/docs/custom-bug-report-service.md)
